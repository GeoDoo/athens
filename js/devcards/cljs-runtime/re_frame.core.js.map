The 1st element identifies the kind of event.\n\n  Note: the event handler is not run immediately - it is not run\n  synchronously. It will likely be run 'very soon', although it may be\n  added to the end of a FIFO queue which already contain events.\n\n  Usage:\n     (dispatch [:order-pizza {:supreme 2 :meatlovers 1 :veg 1}])\"\n  [event]\n  (router/dispatch event))\n\n(defn dispatch-sync\n  \"Synchronously (immediately) process `event`.

And, at that time, re-frame\n  needs to know how to create the node.   By calling `reg-sub`, you are registering\n  'the template' or 'the mechanism' by which nodes in the Signal Graph can be created.\n\n  Repeating: calling `reg-sub` does not create a node. It only creates the template\n  from which nodes can be created later.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and it is expected to have the signature:\n    `(input-values, query-vector) -> a-value`\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the `query-vector` argument will be the vector supplied to the\n  the `subscribe` which caused the node to be created. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"]`.\n\n  The arguments supplied between the `query-id` and the `computation-function` can vary in 3 ways,\n  but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part of the template, controlling what input\n values \\\"flow into\\\" the `computation function` gets when it is called.\n\n  `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways to define the input signals part.\n  But note, the 2nd method, in which a `signal-fn` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and instructive. The other\n  two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  1. No input signals given:\n      ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `input-fn`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  2. A signal function is explicitly supplied:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n       computation-fn)\n     ```\n\n     This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n     The values from returned nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n     the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n     this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n     the structure returned by the `signal-fn`).\n\n     This example `signal-fn` returns a vector of input signals.\n       ```clj\n       (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n       ```\n     The associated computation function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument:\n       ```clj\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         ....)\n        ```\n\n     If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n        ```\n     then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n          ...)\n        ```\n\n     Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n       ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n     is the equivalent of using this\n     2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit input-fn\n       a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n  3. Syntax Sugar\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-b-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       :<- [:b-sub]\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         {:a a :b b}))\n     ```\n\n     This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n     `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n     If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n     as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n         ...))\n     ```\n\n  For further understanding, read `/docs`, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs\n  \"\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub (into [query-id] args)))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which, over\n  time, reactively delivers a stream of values.

The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change.
